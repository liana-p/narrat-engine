# Narrat Template

Template app for [Narrat](https://github.com/nialna/narrat).

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Usage

You can clone, fork or download this to get it in a local folder, then:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Building for the web

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Building as an app

This template has [electron](https://www.electronjs.org) already setup to create a built app of your game.

To run it:

`npm run electron`

`npm run package`

This should work on Windows, Mac and Linux
