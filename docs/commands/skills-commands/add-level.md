See the [skills system guide](../../features/skills-system.md) to know more

skillCheckChoice:
  choice:
    "Should we try jumping over a fence?"
    roll aSkillCheck agility 70 "Try jumping!" hideAfterRoll:
      success:
        "You graciously jump over a fence, hair blowing in the wind, and land in a heroic pose that would be used in a movie trailer."
        talk inner idle "Woo I did it!!!"
        add_level agility 1
      failure:
        "You try jumping over the fence, but not high enough. You stab your toe against the fence and fall head first into a puddle of mud. It's also in the background of a tiktok a passerby was filming now."
        talk inner idle "Ouch!"
```
