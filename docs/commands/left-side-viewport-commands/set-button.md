# Set Button

The `set_button` function can enable or disable a button in a screen.

Syntax: `set_button [buttonId] [true, greyed, hidden or false]`

Refer to the [screens feature](../../features/viewport.md) guide for more info

Example:

```
set_button parkButton true
```

### Possible values

- `true`: Makes the button enabled and clickable (as long as clicking it is allowed, see [screen buttons interaction tags](../../features/viewport.md#button-interaction-tags))
- `false`: Makes the button completely disabled and hidden
- `greyed`: Makes the button disabled and greyed. It will be visible with semi-opacity, but not clickable
- `hidden`: Same as `false`
