# Notify

The notify function in narrat makes a notification appear on the screen

Syntax `notify [text]`

Example:

```renpy
notify "Hello world!"
```

Notifications appear on the corner of the screen with the provided text and stay on screen for some time as setup in the `notifications` part of the config

Some notifications also appear automatically, created by the engine. For example on level up.
