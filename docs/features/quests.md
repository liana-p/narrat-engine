# Quests

Narrat games can have quests with dynamic objectives and a quest log UI

<!-- ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>) -->

Quests can be defined in the quests.yaml config file:

```yaml
quests:
  breadShopping:
    title: Bread Shopping
    description: The helper cat asked you to buy bread for him.
    objectives:
      bread:
        description: Buy bread for the helper cat.
      delivery:
        description: Deliver the bread to the helper cat.
```

The path of `quests.yaml` can be customised in the main config file:

```yaml
quests: data/quests.yaml
```

Scripts can interact with the quest system:

- Start Quest: `start_quest breadShopping`
- Start objective: `start_objective breadShopping delivery` (for hidden objectives)
- Complete objective: `complete_objective breadShopping bread`
- Complete quest: `complete_quest breadShopping`
